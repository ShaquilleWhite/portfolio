     <h2> How I got here </h2>
       <p> It was very important for me to start a career that will allow me to be creative and also be involved with technology and have some person interaction. This brought me to my decision to try the trial at Thinkful for Software Engineering. From day one, I fell in love.</p> 
     <p> Prior to beginning this program I helped build and deploy a couple of site for my husband's clients and it sparked an interest.</p>
     <p> I am enjoying the program and learning JS along with HTML and CSS. I am very eager to get into the Software Engineering field and put my newly found skills to work.  </p>
